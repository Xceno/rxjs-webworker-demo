# Handling webworkers with rxjs

This demo uses [react](https://reactjs.org/) and webpacks [worker-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/worker-loader/)
This project demonstrates how to use RxJs to communicate with web workers.
The source code is [free for everyone to use](https://github.com/Xceno/rxjs-webworker-demo/blob/master/LICENSE) and battle tested (Used in various projects since 2017).

The heart of this demo is the [src/worker](https://github.com/Xceno/rxjs-webworker-demo/tree/master/src/worker) folder.
