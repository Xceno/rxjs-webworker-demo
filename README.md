Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project demonstrates how to use RxJs to communicate with web workers.
The source code is [free for everyone to use](https://github.com/Xceno/rxjs-webworker-demo/blob/master/LICENSE) and battle tested.

The heart of this demo is the [src/worker](https://github.com/Xceno/rxjs-webworker-demo/tree/master/src/worker) folder.

A blog post with all the details is in the works and will be published [on my blog](https://www.xceno.io).
